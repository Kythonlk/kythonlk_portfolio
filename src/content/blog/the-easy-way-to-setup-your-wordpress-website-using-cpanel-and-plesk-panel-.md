<h2>Section 1: Setting Up WordPress Using cPanel</h2>
<p>Step 1: Download the WordPress Zip File</p>
<p>Before you begin, head over to the official WordPress website (wordpress.org) and download the latest version of WordPress as a zip file. This file contains all the necessary files for your website.</p>
<p>Step 2: Upload the WordPress Zip File</p>
<p>Access your cPanel dashboard and locate the &#8216;File Manager&#8217; option. Open it, and navigate to the &#8216;public_html&#8217; directory, which is the root directory for your website. Click on the &#8216;Upload&#8217; button and select the WordPress zip file you just downloaded. Once it&#8217;s uploaded, extract the files.</p>
<h2>Section 2: Configuring the Database</h2>
<p>Step 3: Create a Database</p>
<p>In cPanel, find the &#8216;MySQL® Databases&#8217; option and click on it. Create a new database by entering a name and clicking &#8216;Create Database&#8217;. Remember to note down the database name as you will need it later.</p>
<p>Step 4: Create a Database User</p>
<p>Still within the &#8216;MySQL® Databases&#8217; section, scroll down to &#8216;MySQL Users&#8217; and create a new user. Fill in the details and click &#8216;Create User&#8217;. Make sure to note down the username and password.</p>
<p>Step 5: Assign User to Database</p>
<p>Next, go back to the &#8216;MySQL® Databases&#8217; section and scroll down to the &#8216;Add User to Database&#8217; option. Select the user and the database created earlier, and click &#8216;Add&#8217;.</p>
<h2>Section 3: Installing WordPress</h2>
<p>Step 6: Configure WordPress</p>
<p>Open a web browser and navigate to your website&#8217;s domain name. You will see the WordPress installation wizard. Select your preferred language and click &#8216;Continue&#8217;. Enter the database information you noted down earlier and click &#8216;Submit&#8217;.</p>
<p>Step 7: Complete the Installation</p>
<p>On the next page, fill in your website title, username, and password. You can also provide your email address for important notifications. Once done, click &#8216;Install WordPress&#8217;.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have successfully set up your WordPress website using cPanel. Now, you can start customizing your website and creating amazing content.</p>
